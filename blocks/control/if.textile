While being able to repeat blocks of code is great, you will also probably need to be able to use if statements. BlocklyProp makes this easy. Below is a simple example. All you have to do to get the if block to work is add a statement with a returning value of either true or false, and add the code you would like to execute based on whether the if statement is true or not.
