Documentation for BlocklyProp

## Writing manuals

* Write all text pages in [textile](http://txstyle.org/article/34/textile-resources)
* For other languages, outside english, postfix filename by an underscore and the short language code. For example: `index_es.textile`
* Prepend all links and images with `help?f=`
* For links to textile pages omit the `.textile` extension
* See also a [textile example page](textileexample.textile)
* All pages should contain a paragraph with the class `short` that will be shown only in the search results
* h1 should not be used
* The main header should be a h2 and there should only be one h2 title as only the first one will be shown in the search results
* Check out the `test-tool` branch for a tool that previews help pages and can alert for basic mistakes
